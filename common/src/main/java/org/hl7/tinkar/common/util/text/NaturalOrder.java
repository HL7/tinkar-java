    * From stack overflow...
    * The implementation I propose here is simple and efficient. 
    * It does not allocate any extra memory, directly or indirectly 
    * by using regular expressions or methods such as substring(), 
    * split(), toCharArray(), etc.
    *
    * This implementation first goes across both strings to search for the 
    * first characters that are different, at maximal speed, without doing 
    * any special processing during this. Specific number comparison is 
    * triggered only when these characters are both digits. A side-effect 
    * of this implementation is that a digit is considered as greater than 
    * other letters, contrarily to default lexicographic order.
    * @param s1 first string
    * @param s2 second string
    * @return result of comparison
